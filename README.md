RStudio project for the template "year in review".

My version of it is [here](https://rud.is/rpubs/2017-year-in-review/).

This template is sans-quantified-self-commentary.

Read the Rmd before trying to run it.

You will need to have:

- StackOverflow userid
- GitHub username
- Twitter archive download file

and enable/disable WordPress stuff for inclusion

## Thanks!

to @dataandme, @mrshrbrmstr & @henrikbengtsson for their help!
